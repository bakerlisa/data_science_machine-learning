# Machine Learning

"What the crowd says? Why they shout?" ðŸ¤¯ 

"Well" I shout back "Why not?!" 

"But you just took a course they'll say. Stop. Don't you want to relax?"

ðŸ˜‚ I'll laugh and say, I can do more relqxing when I work hard AND smart! Which is why I want to take this course. I see ML and DS as a fiekld that will only continue to gorw! I want to know how to use it in my personal projects and get paid for it! 

Since Coding Dojo is an amazing organizition it was a no brainer to take the course with them!

Here is where I'll put all, or most of my assigments and projects, stay tuned!
